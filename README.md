This is small Web Project, the goal was to let a user create a survey, send it to people to fill and see the submitted ansewrs.
The client is written in React, the server is build with python(Flask) and the DB I used is MongoDB.

In order to run the client please do the following:

In the folder run cmd and run the following commands:
npm install -g yarn .
after that please verify you have version 1.22 with the command:
yarn --version 

in order to run the program first run the server:
in the server folder run in the cmd:
pip install -r requirements.txt
then run:
python main.py

after you have installed yarn run the following commands:
yarn install

when you wish you run the client run:
yarn start .



P.S
this is Still an ongoing Project, I currently work on the design and the "looks" of the Client.
